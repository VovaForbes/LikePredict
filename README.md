# LikePredict
Here is solution of Gardeners team. Our 3 top solutions are quite similar and there is only difference in parameters of catboost model. So we decided not to put only the cleanest notebook here. The main idea was combinig 
several catboost models with respect to data specifications and events distribution. This solution could be easily improved 
by tuning parmeters with Bayes search. And one more tip. There are 8 models, but for the best predictions it could be very useful to research which model performs on different datatypes better. We didn't have enough time to do this.

And in case u want to get list of all our features here is the link with according files. https://yadi.sk/d/_np59WdoC-ttbA
